# tetris-in-kotlin

The classic block dropping thing game!

Unpolished, but it seems to play OK?

The code needs formatting etc but makes more sense than I remember it making.
The shapes have a pivot block (unless the are symmetrical in which case its null and they don't rotate) that they rotate about.

I don't know much about gradle don't ask me about setup, building, etc.
If you can get it to work the controls are keys z, x, arrows, escape I think do stuff.
